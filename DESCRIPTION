Authors@R: person("Elnaz", "Khaveh", email="elnaz.khaveh@gmail.com", role= c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package allows users to do some Explanatory Data Analysis with visualizations. Also it
    trains random forest models to predict the charges from the dataset "insurance". The
    package is not generalized yet so it only works for the dataset "insurance" to predict
    the target variable "charges".
